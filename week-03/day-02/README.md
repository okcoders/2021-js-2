## Exercise
- npm project from scratch
- search for nodemailer package on google and find the documentation
- install nodemailer
- make an index.js file and import/require nodemailer in it

## Daily standup email generator 

- emailed out to team daily
- completed tasks from day before
- upcoming/active tasks

- distro list
	- email, name 
	- for a real project, we would potentially talk with the task server to get latest tasks, but for this project we will hardcode the tasks

## Template Tag

## Map and Filter

## Homework

- install node-cron to the project
- try to schedule the email to be sent daily at 8am
- you will probably need to test that it works at a different frequency first (e.g every minute), and then update it 
- if you'd like, you could login to your own email and try to send a real email to yourself
- get up and running with github desktop: https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop
